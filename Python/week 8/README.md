2. Open a terminal or command prompt.
3. Install the required libraries (if not already installed):
   ```bash
   pip install pandas matplotlib seaborn plotly
   ```
4. Download the dataset:
   From: Our World in Data – COVID-19 Data
   Ensure the data url is not changed.
5. Run the script:
   ```bash
   python covid_global_tracker.py
   ```

### ▶️ 🧪 Option 2: Use the Jupyter Notebook

1. Install Jupyter Notebook if you don’t have it:
   ```bash
   pip install notebook
   ```
2. Launch Jupyter:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```
3. Copy and/or Rename covid_global_tracker.py to covid_global_tracker.ipynb.
